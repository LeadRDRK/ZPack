Changelog
----------
  v0.3.0   Changed the filename length to an unsigned short
           integer (2 bytes)
           Added file naming rules.
  v0.2.1   Removed some unnecessary information.
  v0.2.0   Added a uncompressed size field in the file 
           record.
  v0.1.0   Added a file offset field in the file record.
  
Synopsis
---------
  ZPack is a simple, general-purpose archive file
  format with lossless data compression.
  
  It exclusively uses the Zstandard compression algorithm
  for file compression (hence the name). The default
  compression level is 19.

  The file extension for ZPack-formatted files is .zpk
  
General format of a ZPack file
-------------------------------
  [ZPack header]
  [File data 1]
  [File data 2]
  ...
  [File data n]
  [Central directory record]
  [End of central directory record]
  
  All values must be stored in little-endian byte order
  unless specifically noted.

ZPack header
-------------
  magic number               4 bytes (0x5a504b15)
  minimum version required   2 bytes

Central directory record
-------------------------
  A central directory record is a collection of
  multiple file records and follows the following
  format:
  
  signature                  4 bytes (0x5a504b14)
  [file record 1]
  [file record 2]
  ...
  [file record n]
  
File record
------------
  Contains information about a file.
  The filename follows a specific set of rules; see the
  "File naming rules" section below.

  filename length (n)        2 bytes
  filename                   n bytes
  file offset                8 bytes
  compressed size            8 bytes
  uncompressed size          8 bytes
  file hash (crc32)          4 bytes

End of central directory record
--------------------------------
  Because the file data section is of a variable size,
  an end of central directory record is needed to determine
  the offset of the central directory record.

  signature                  4 bytes (0x5a504b13)
  central dir record offset  8 bytes

File naming rules
-----------------
  The filename can be a path (e.g. path/to/file).
  However, it must not be relative to any directory,
  either in the archive or in the user's filesystem.

  These filenames are considered illegal:
  * path/../to/file
  * ../path/to/file
  * path/./to/file
  * ./path/to/file

  The path may contain forward slashes (/) or backward
  slashes (\) depending on the filesystem/operating
  system that the archive was created on.

  The max filename length is 65535 characters.
