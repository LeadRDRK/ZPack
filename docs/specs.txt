Synopsis
---------
  ZPack is a simple, general-purpose archive file
  format with lossless data compression. It is based 
  on the ZIP/ZIP64 format by PKWARE.
  
  It exclusively uses the Zstandard compression algorithm
  for file compression (hence the name). The default
  compression level is 19.

  The file extension for ZPack-formatted files is .zpk
